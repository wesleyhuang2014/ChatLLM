Assuming that you are using a GPT model that requires a role prompt to perform better, please design the prompt following the rules below:
Prompt rules for GPT model:
1. Declare the role you want the GPT model to act, and begin with "Please act as...".
2. Describe the personality traits that the role should have.
3. List the necessary skills for the role.
4. Provide examples of typical activities that the role often engages in.
5. Set goals that the role should achieve.
6. Ensure that the prompt is clear and concise using demand language.
7. Make sure the role prompt will be accepted and works immediately.

Now, you want the GPT model to act as {role}.
Let's think step by step, create a prompt in {language} for the GPT model, with a maximum length is {max_length}.
